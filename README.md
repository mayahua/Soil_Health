# Soil Health Data Analysis and Modelling

This repository contains code for **processing, cleaning, imputing, modelling, and analysing soil data**. The project is based on the *SoilHealthDB* dataset, which compiles 5,907 comparisons across 42 soil health indicators and 46 background indicators from 321 scientific papers.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [SoilHealthDB (V2)] â€“ available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jinshijian/SoilHealthDB), with details in the publication: Jian, J., Du, X. & Stewart, R.D. *A database for global soil health assessment.* Scientific Data 7, 16 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0356-3
- **Contents:**  
  - 42 Soil health indicators (e.g., bulk density, cation exchange capacity, yield).  
  - 46 Background indicators (e.g., climate, elevation, soil texture).  
- **Format:** Provided as both `.xlsx` and `.csv`. The code primarily works with the `.xlsx` file to avoid data corruption (e.g., auto-conversion of IDs to dates).  
- **Access:** This repository does **not include the dataset**. Instead, the code will automatically download it from the official source.

## Disclaimer

I developed this code during my research internship to investigate the application of machine learning methods to recent soil health datasets.  

- An **official repository** for this project will be maintained by lead investigators (Dr Stuart King & Prof Jonathan Hillier).  
- The **results of this code** will be used in future publications.  
- This repository is intended for **demonstration purposes** and may not represent the final version of the analysis pipeline.  

**Important Usage Terms:**  
- Allowed for individual, academic, research, and commercial use.  
- Cannot be repackaged or resold without written permission.  
- If you use this dataset, please cite both this GitHub page and the associated publications (see [License & Citation](#license--citation) below).

## Code Structure

### 1. Data Cleaning
The pipeline includes:
- Fixing misformatted Experiment IDs.  
- Removing redundant or inconsistent columns.  
- Handling unit inconsistencies using the provided "comments".  
- Missing data imputation for **sand, silt, and clay** percentages using USDA soil texture triangle.  
- Excluding outliers based on thresholds.

### 2. Data Visualization
The code provides multiple visualizations to explore and assess the dataset, including:  
- Plots of missing data patterns.  
- Checks for replicated Experiment IDs and site coordinates.  
- Scatterplot matrices with Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients.  
- Histograms of soil health indicators.  
- Cumulative distribution plots for cash crop yield.

### 3. Modelling
A unified modelling function was developed supporting categorical predictors and different input structures.  
Implemented regression models include:
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
- KNN Regression  
- Decision Tree  
- Random Forest  
- XGBoost (standard & Random Forest)  
- Generalized Additive Model (GAM)  

**Model Evaluation:**  
- MAE, RMSE, RÂ²  
- K-fold cross-validation  
- Feature importance (permutation, SHAP, coefficients, partial dependence plots)  

### 4. Missing Data Imputation
Best-performing models were used to impute missing values for key soil indicators:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Feature</th>
    <th>Model Used</th>
    <th>Imputed Values</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CEC (Control)</td>
    <td>GAM</td>
    <td>351</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CEC (Treatment)</td>
    <td>SVR</td>
    <td>351</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BD (Control)</td>
    <td>XGBoost RF</td>
    <td>654</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>BD (Treatment)</td>
    <td>Random Forest</td>
    <td>612</td>
  </tr>
</table>

### 5. Statistical Testing
Statistical analyses were conducted to evaluate the effects of different conservation treatments:
  - Shapiro-Wilk (normality check)  
  - Mann-Whitney U test  
  - Wilcoxon signed-rank test
